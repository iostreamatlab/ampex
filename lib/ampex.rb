# NOTE: Ruby 1.9 seems to provide a default blank slate that isn't
# very blank, luckily it also provides a BasicObject which is pretty
# basic.

  # When you pass an argument with & in ruby, you're actually calling #to_proc

  # This method is here so that a metavariable can be used as a target for "when" like this:
  #
  #   case foo

  # Metavariable that is like the last but does something more.
  #
  # The end result of calling X.one.two will be like:

  # lambda{|x|
  #   (lambda{|x|
  #     (lambda{|x| x}).call(x).one
  #   }).call(x).two
